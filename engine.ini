[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1		; Sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.150					; Engine inertia
LIMITER=7200					; Engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=22					; Frequency of engine limiter
MINIMUM=1000					; Idle rpm

[COAST_REF]
RPM=4000						; Rev number reference
TORQUE=97						; Engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY=0					; Coast engine brake from zero to torque value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.997					; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.992					; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=1.4					; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=1.4				; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=1.4			; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=2500				; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=1.0						; Turbo pressure sensitivity on accelerator pedal
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0			; Cockpit adjustable turbo pressure

[DAMAGE]
TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD=2.7
TURBO_DAMAGE_K=5				; Amount of damage per second per (boost - threshold)
RPM_THRESHOLD=7500				; Rpm at which the engine starts to take damage
RPM_DAMAGE_K=3					; Amount of damage per second per (rpm-threshold)
